Recently, more comprehensive approaches have emerged that integrate genetic factors with additional lifestyle factors (e.g., alcohol intake) and physical features (e.g., body mass index, age) to increase predictive accuracy.

        "summary": "The electrocardiogram (ECG) is an almost universally accessible diagnostic tool for heart disease. An ECG is measured by using an electrocardiograph, and today's electrocardiographs use built-in software to interpret the ECGs automatically after they are recorded. However, these algorithms exhibit limited performance, and therefore, clinicians usually have to manually interpret the ECG, regardless of whether an algorithm has interpreted it or not. Manual interpretation of the ECG can be time-consuming and requires specific skills. Therefore, better algorithms are clearly needed to make correct",

Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) characterized peptide profiles of DGS hot meat (DGSH) and chilled meat (DGSC), revealing a greater umami peptide potential in DGSC. Seven potential umami peptides were screened via bioinformatics and conformational relationship analysis. Sensory evaluation showed five novel peptides (VEGK, VESL, LEEK, LPEAL, and KRLMEDTED) had umami thresholds of 0.21-0.48 mg/mL. Electronic tongue anal",

Ehling, Minot et al. establish a synthetic coevolution system that combines high-throughput screening with a fit-for-purpose protein language model to map the adaptive mutational trajectories of neutralizing antibodies and the viral receptor-binding domain. This system reveals antagonistic and compensatory mutations, identifies convergent escape mutations, and demonstrates how synthetic somatic hypermutation can rapidly evolve antibodies to overco",
