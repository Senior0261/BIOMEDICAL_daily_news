The application of different algorithms has spawned various tools for the determination of read rejection. However, an evaluation in conjunction with identifying the optimal enrichment performance for a specific task has yet to be conducted. Results: This study aimed to evaluate the performance of six widely used tools for nanopore adaptive sampling. Three distinct types of tasks were selected for testing, including the intraspecies enrichment of COSMIC genes, the interspecies enrichment of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the depletion of human host DNA. All the tools show increases in coverage depths of targets varying from 1.50- to 4.86-fold. T…",

Recently, more comprehensive approaches have emerged that integrate genetic factors with additional lifestyle factors (e.g., alcohol intake) and physical features (e.g., body mass index, age) to increase predictive accuracy. Since the onset of complex diseases is often accompanied by the occurrence of comorbidities, incorporating medical history records is a critical yet underexplored avenue for improving risk prediction.

        "summary": "Despite mounting evidence that the air-water interface or microdroplet geometry has no bearing on the spontaneous formation of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) down to a 50 nM limit of detection, the debate persists. Recent studies have demonstrated connections between the spontaneous formation of hydroxyl (HO • ) radicals and H 2 O 2 in sprayed microdroplets and the solution pH, dissolved salts, nebulizing gas, and gaseous environment. Among the halides, chloride (Cl - ), bromide (Br - ), and iodide (I - ), the studies found that Br - dominated H 2 O 2 formation because of its enhanced fractionation at the air-water interface and ability to donate electrons. The studies also suggested that H 2 O 2 production at the air-water interface scales with the alkalinity of water. In response, this rep…",

However, conventional designs face a trade-off between achieving high magnetic force and flexibility due to uniform particle distribution. Herein, we propose a novel microscale structure developed by a microscale structure-constrained fluidic formation technique, effectively addressing this limitation and allowing for controlled magnetic powder agglomeration. This approach yields actuators with a low elastic modulus (0.5 MPa) and high magnetic force (12 mN), synergistically combining flexibility and actuation. These performance characteristics significantly advance existing actuators that typically compromise one property for the other. The resulting…",

First, we optimized Thai's assay by adapting it to a droplet format and increased its throughput by combining droplet microfluidics and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Then, we demonstrated that our new assay was reliable and sensitive by successfully screening a library of 1.5 million clones.

The application of different algorithms has spawned various tools for the determination of read rejection. However, an evaluation in conjunction with identifying the optimal enrichment performance for a specific task has yet to be conducted. Results: This study aimed to evaluate the performance of six widely used tools for nanopore adaptive sampling. Three distinct types of tasks were selected for testing, including the intraspecies enrichment of COSMIC genes, the interspecies enrichment of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the depletion of human host DNA. All the tools show increases in coverage depths of targets varying from 1.50- to 4.86-fold. T…",

We present a hierarchical count model that is motivated by the data generating process of scATAC-seq data.

Since the onset of complex diseases is often accompanied by the occurrence of comorbidities, incorporating medical history records is a critical yet underexplored avenue for improving risk prediction.

        "summary": "Summary: Microbiome HiFi Amplicon Sequence Simulator (MHASS) creates realistic synthetic PacBio HiFi amplicon sequencing datasets for microbiome studies, by integrating genome-aware abundance modeling, realistic dual-barcoding strategies, and empirically derived pass-number distributions from actual sequencing runs. MHASS generates datasets tailored for rigorous benchmarking and validation of long-read microbiome analysis workflows, including ASV clustering and taxonomic assignment. Availability and Implementation: Implemented in Python with automated dependency management, the source code for MHASS is freely available at https://github.com/rhowardstone/MHASS along with installation instructions.
