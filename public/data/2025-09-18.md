  Background: Adaptive sampling is an emerging technology to enrich target reads while depleting unwanted reads during real-time nanopore sequencing. The application of different algorithms has spawned various tools for the determination of read rejection. However, an evaluation in conjunction with identifying the optimal enrichment performance for a specific task has yet to be conducted. Results: This study aimed to evaluate the performance of six widely used tools for nanopore adaptive sampling. Three distinct types of tasks were selected for testing, including the intraspecies enrichment of COSMIC genes, the interspecies enrichment of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the depletion of human host DNA. All the tools show increases in coverage depths of targets varying from 1.50- to 4.86-fold. T…

  Traditional disease risk prediction models predominantly rely on statistical algorithms and often focus on genetic factors or a limited set of lifestyle factors to estimate the risk of disease onset. Recently, more comprehensive approaches have emerged that integrate genetic factors with additional lifestyle factors (e.g., alcohol intake) and physical features (e.g., body mass index, age) to increase predictive accuracy. Since the onset of complex diseases is often accompanied by the occurrence of comorbidities, incorporating medical history records is a critical yet underexplored avenue for improving risk prediction. In this study, we propose a novel framework, MIDRP (Multi-source Integration for Disease Risk Prediction), which incorporates genetic variants, lifestyle factors, physical at…

  Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition and the most common form of dementia. Recent developments in AD treatment call for robust diagnostic tools to facilitate medical decision-making. Despite progress for early diagnostic tests, there remains uncertainty about clinical use. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as a readily available imaging tool in the current AD diagnostic pathway, in combination with artificial intelligence, offers opportunities of added value beyond symptomatic evaluation. However, MRI studies in AD tend to suffer from small datasets and consequently limited generalizability. Although ensemble models take advantage of the strengths of several models to improve performance and generalizability, there is little knowledge of how the different en…

  Perceptual decision-making is thought to be mediated by neuronal networks with attractor dynamics 1,2 . However, the dynamics underlying the complex neuronal responses during decision-making remain unclear. Here we use simultaneous recordings of hundreds of neurons, combined with an unsupervised, deep-learning-based method, to discover decision-related neural dynamics in the rat frontal cortex and striatum as animals accumulate pulsatile auditory evidence. We found that trajectories evolved along two sequential regimes: an initial phase dominated by sensory inputs, followed by a phase dominated by autonomous dynamics, with the flow direction (that is, neural mode) largely orthogonal to that in the first regime. We propose that this transition marks the moment of decision commitment, that i…

  Discovering how computations are implemented in the brain at the level of monosynaptic connectivity requires probing for connections from potentially thousands of presynaptic candidate neurons. Two-photon optogenetics is a promising technology for mapping such connectivity via sequential stimulation of individual neurons while recording postsynaptic responses intracellularly. However, this technique is currently not scalable because stimulating neurons one by one requires prohibitively long experiments. Here we developed novel computational tools that, when combined, enable learning of monosynaptic connectivity from high-speed holographic ensemble stimulation. First, we developed a model-based compressed sensing algorithm that identifies connections from postsynaptic responses evoked by st…

  Deciphering the pre-malignant cell of origin (COO) of different cancers is critical for understanding tumor development and improving diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in oncology. Prior work demonstrates that somatic mutations preferentially accumulate in closed chromatin regions of a cancer's COO. Leveraging this information, we combine 3,669 whole genome sequencing patient samples, 559 single-cell chromatin accessibility cellular profiles, and machine learning to predict the COO of 37 cancer subtypes with high robustness and accuracy, confirming both the known anatomical and cellular origins of numerous cancers, often at cell subset resolution. Importantly, our data-driven approach predicts a basal COO for most small cell lung cancers and a neuroendocrine COO for rare atypical cases…

  Traditionally, CT has been the go-to method for visualizing bone structures, while MRI has been preferred for assessing soft tissues, because structures containing tightly bound water molecules - such as bones, tendons, cartilage, and ligaments - produce a rapidly decaying T2* signal, which conventional MRI sequences fail to capture. To address this limitation, spoiled gradient echo sequences were refined, and short-TE sequences were introduced, enabling radiation-free bone imaging. This advance is particularly crucial for pediatric patients and in scenarios where an MRI-only approach is preferred, such as in radiation-sensitive cases and surgical planning.A comprehensive literature review was conducted by searching the PubMed and Google Scholar databases, using specific keywords: "black b…

  The mechanical properties of biological fluids serve as early indicators of disease, offering valuable insights into complex physiological and pathological processes. However, the existing technologies struggle to achieve high-throughput measurement, limiting their widespread applications in disease diagnosis. Here, we propose laser-emission vibrational microscopy of microdroplets for high-throughput measurement of the intrinsic mechanical properties of fluids. The microdroplet array supporting high Q-factor (10 4 ) whispering gallery modes (WGM) lasing was massively fabricated on a superhydrophobic surface with inkjet printing. Ultrasound was employed to actuate the mechanical vibrations of the microdroplets, and the vibration amplitude was quantified using time-resolved laser spectra. We…

  The clinical translation of liposome-based nanomedicines is limited by the lack of scalable production methods ensuring precise control over particle size and homogeneity. While microfluidics offers a promising single-step solution for manufacturing liposomes with desired attributes, limited throughput remains the main constraint for its industrial-scale integration. Here we present a versatile fluidic system utilizing simple and commercially available T-shaped mixers for scalable production of highly monodisperse liposomes, ranging from few mL/min to 30 L/h of Total Flow Rate (TFR). Firstly, to characterize the platform, the influence of TFR and diverse flow regimes on size and Polidispersity Index (PDI) of empty-Doxil® liposomes was investigated. Notably, particle homogeneity and reprodu…

  Background: The distal nephron, which includes the thick ascending limb, distal convoluted tubule, connecting tubule, and collecting duct, is essential for the regulation of water and electrolyte balance. Injury or dysfunction of these segments contributes to significant kidney disease and systemic complications. Studying these regions directly in vivo is limited by the complexity of kidney architecture. Recently, three-dimensional cultures of human kidney tubule cells, called tubuloids, and microfluidic platforms that support dynamic flow have provided new opportunities to model kidney function in vitro. Methods: We developed a human distal tubuloid-on-a-chip model by integrating primary human tubuloid cells with the OrganoPlate® microfluidic culture system. Tubuloids were seeded to form…

  Alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells play a pivotal role in maintaining lung homeostasis, and the generation of three-dimensional cultures, such as alveolospheres, provides a valuable model for studying lung development, pathologies, and drug responses. Here, we investigate the critical extracellular matrix (ECM) characteristics that influence AT2 alveolosphere formation and growth. By encapsulating AT2 cells in different extracellular matrix-based hydrogels, we identified laminin as a key ECM protein supporting robust alveolosphere formation akin to Matrigel. Our results show that laminin-rich hydrogels support alveolosphere formation across murine and human primary AT2 cells as well as induced human pluripotent stem cell derived AT2 cells (iAT2 cells). Notably, matrix stiffness strongly influence…

  Despite mounting evidence that the air-water interface or microdroplet geometry has no bearing on the spontaneous formation of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) down to a 50 nM limit of detection, the debate persists. Recent studies have demonstrated connections between the spontaneous formation of hydroxyl (HO • ) radicals and H 2 O 2 in sprayed microdroplets and the solution pH, dissolved salts, nebulizing gas, and gaseous environment. Among the halides, chloride (Cl - ), bromide (Br - ), and iodide (I - ), the studies found that Br - dominated H 2 O 2 formation because of its enhanced fractionation at the air-water interface and ability to donate electrons. The studies also suggested that H 2 O 2 production at the air-water interface scales with the alkalinity of water. In response, this rep…

  Magnetic soft actuators are promising for biomedical and soft robotic applications due to their biocompatibility and magnetic responsiveness. However, conventional designs face a trade-off between achieving high magnetic force and flexibility due to uniform particle distribution. Herein, we propose a novel microscale structure developed by a microscale structure-constrained fluidic formation technique, effectively addressing this limitation and allowing for controlled magnetic powder agglomeration. This approach yields actuators with a low elastic modulus (0.5 MPa) and high magnetic force (12 mN), synergistically combining flexibility and actuation. These performance characteristics significantly advance existing actuators that typically compromise one property for the other. The resulting…

  Ketoreductases (KREDs) have become increasingly valuable biocatalysts due to their ability to produce chiral alcohols with high enantioselectivity. Prior to our work, Thai et al. developed an efficient and easy assay for their discovery, but the throughput was limited. Based on their work, we developed an ultrahigh-throughput screening assay to discover KREDs. First, we optimized Thai's assay by adapting it to a droplet format and increased its throughput by combining droplet microfluidics and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Then, we demonstrated that our new assay was reliable and sensitive by successfully screening a library of 1.5 million clones. This allowed us to discover KREDs with low identity with known enzymes or with a previously undescribed substrate scope, which cou…

  One-pot CRISPR-based detection combining recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) enables rapid and accurate nucleic acid testing but faces challenges in performance, multiplexing, and field-ready lyophilization. Here, an enhanced one-pot, helicase-assisted RPA (hRPA)-combined, dual-CRISPR/uAsCas12a (EOD-CRISPR) assay is described which can be lyophilized on a 3D-printed microfluidic disc to achieve field-deployable multiplex bacteria detection. In EOD-CRISPR reactions, the reaction speed, sensitivity, and fluorescence signal are significantly enhanced due to the synergistic effect of bovine serum albumin, hRPA, and uAsCas12a nuclease. The 3D-printed disc features four central chambers encircled by eight outer chambers, permitting detecting four targets simultaneously. For stable lyophil…

  Microfluidic paper-based electrochemical devices (μPEDs) are transforming cost-effective and portable diagnostics. However, conventional μPEDs are limited to a single use, as the removal of analyzed solutions is challenging, preventing repeatable measurements. This study introduces a paper-based fast-flow electrochemical device (PFED) design that overcomes this limitation, enabling multiple detections within a single device without requiring external power. Unlike traditional μPEDs, the PFED integrates a plastic hollow channel with a wax-printed channel, ensuring that fluid flow is not solely dependent on capillary action. This enhanced configuration accelerates liquid transport, facilitates rapid solution exchange, and significantly improves device repeatability. Additionally, the PFED, c…

  Deciphering the pre-malignant cell of origin (COO) of different cancers is critical for understanding tumor development and improving diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in oncology. Prior work demonstrates that somatic mutations preferentially accumulate in closed chromatin regions of a cancer's COO. Leveraging this information, we combine 3,669 whole genome sequencing patient samples, 559 single-cell chromatin accessibility cellular profiles, and machine learning to predict the COO of 37 cancer subtypes with high robustness and accuracy, confirming both the known anatomical and cellular origins of numerous cancers, often at cell subset resolution. Importantly, our data-driven approach predicts a basal COO for most small cell lung cancers and a neuroendocrine COO for rare atypical cases…

Anemia causes tissue hypoxia, which may alter the hematopoiesis niche in the liver. This study utilized our preclinical mouse model of phlebotomy-induced anemia (PIA) to investigate the immune cell atlas in the liver. Methods: C57BL/6 mice were subjected to timed phlebotomy between postnatal days 2-10 to induce severe anemia. Immune cells in anemic liver were characterized by Single-cell (sc) RNA-sequencing and a flow cytometry approach. Results: The scRNA-seq analysis revealed that PIA is associated with an altered immune landscape o…

  In medical oncology, text data, such as clinical letters or procedure reports, is stored in an unstructured way, making quantitative analysis difficult. Manual review or structured information retrieval is time-consuming and costly, whereas Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new possibilities in natural language processing for structured Information Extraction (IE) from medical free text. This protocol describes a workflow (LLM-AIx) for extracting predefined clinical entities from unstructured oncology text using privacy-preserving LLMs. It addresses a key barrier in clinical research and care by enabling efficient information extraction to support decision-making and large-scale data analysis. It runs on local hospital infrastructure, eliminating the need to transfer patient data external…

  Background: Abnormal circulating lipid levels have been suggested in relation to lymphoid malignancy (LM) risk. Methods: We studied UK Biobank participants (n = 403,625) with serum data for cholesterol (total [TC], high-density lipoprotein [HDL], direct low-density lipoprotein [LDL]), triglycerides (TG), and apolipoproteins A1 and B (ApoA1, ApoB). We conducted principal component (PC) analysis and multivariate Cox regression models to estimate hazard ratio (HR) overall, by lipid-lowering drug use and follow-up interval. Results: During an average of 10.5 years of follow-up, 3006 incident LMs occurred (including 667 multiple myelomas [MM], 2193 non-Hodgkin lymphomas [NHL]). Among medication non-users, most lipid levels were inversely associated with risk of most endpoints (HR Q4vsQ1 range:…

- **[Deciphering the central role of TMOD2 in colorectal cancer progression and metastasis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40962847/)**

  Tropomodulin-2 (TMOD2) is upregulated in the nuclear compartment of highly liver metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Its role in cancer and CRC progression is functionally undefined, despite its analysis in COAD and READ TCGA datasets revealing a correlation between high TMOD2 expression, advanced disease stages, and poorer survival in CRC patients. We aimed here to explore the role of TMOD2 in CRC and liver metastasis using functional proteomics, tumour samples, bioinformatics, and in vitro and in vivo CRC models. Stable overexpression and stable depletion of TMOD2 in isogenic CRC cells revealed its impact on tumorigenic and metastatic properties. TMOD2 overexpression enhanced cell adhesion, anchorage-independent growth, and migration, while stably TMOD2 depletion reduced them. In v…

  Caffeine metabolic ratios (CMR) following monitored caffeine intake are the gold standard to probe cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 activity, which metabolizes antipsychotics like clozapine and olanzapine. Given caffeine's ubiquity, we tested whether random CMR from dietary caffeine were associated with (1) clinical, genetic, and epigenetic factors linked to CYP1A2 activity; (2) plasma concentrations of clozapine and olanzapine; and (3) psychotropic treatment response. First, we analyzed two population-based studies (CoLaus|PsyCoLaus, N = 4898; SKIPOGH, N = 2054) to investigate random CMR associations with clinical, genome-wide, and epigenome-wide factors associated with CYP1A2 activity. Second, in psychiatric cohorts, we tested CMR associations with dose-normalized plasma concentrations (C/D) of…

  Sequencing of PCR amplicons generated using degenerate primers (typically targeting a region of the 16S ribosomal gene) is widely used in metagenomics to profile the taxonomic composition of complex microbial samples. To reduce taxonomic biases in primer selection it is important to conduct in silico PCR analyses of the primers against large collections of up to millions of bacterial genomes. However, existing in silico PCR tools have impractical running time for analyses of this scale. In this paper we introduce AmpliconHunter, a highly scalable in silico PCR package distributed as open-source command-line tool and publicly available through a user-friendly web interface at https://ah1.engr.uconn.edu/. AmpliconHunter implements an accurate nearest-neighbor model for melting temperature ca…

  Imbalanced and small data regimes are pervasive in domains such as rare disease imaging, genomics, and disaster response, where labeled samples are scarce and naive augmentation often introduces artifacts. Existing solutions such as oversampling, focal loss, or meta-weighting address isolated aspects of this challenge but remain fragile or complex. We introduce FOSSIL (Flexible Optimization via Sample Sensitive Importance Learning), a unified weighting framework that seamlessly integrates class imbalance correction, difficulty-aware curricula, augmentation penalties, and warmup dynamics into a single interpretable formula. Unlike prior heuristics, the proposed framework provides regret-based theoretical guarantees and achieves consistent empirical gains over ERM, curriculum, and meta-weigh…

  Despite significant medical advancements, cancer remains the second leading cause of death, with over 600,000 deaths per year in the US. One emerging field, pathway analysis, is promising but still relies on manually derived wet lab data, which is time-consuming to acquire. This work proposes an efficient, effective end-to-end framework for Artificial Intelligence (AI) based pathway analysis that predicts both cancer severity and mutation progression, thus recommending possible treatments. The proposed technique involves a novel combination of time-series machine learning models and pathway analysis. First, mutation sequences were isolated from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Database. Then, a novel preprocessing algorithm was used to filter key mutations by mutation frequency. This data wa…

  Multimodal data provides heterogeneous information for a holistic understanding of the tumor microenvironment. However, existing AI models often struggle to harness the rich information within multimodal data and extract poorly generalizable representations. Here we present MICE (Multimodal data Integration via Collaborative Experts), a multimodal foundation model that effectively integrates pathology images, clinical reports, and genomics data for precise pan-cancer prognosis prediction. Instead of conventional multi-expert modules, MICE employs multiple functionally diverse experts to comprehensively capture both cross-cancer and cancer-specific insights. Leveraging data from 11,799 patients across 30 cancer types, we enhanced MICE's generalizability by coupling contrastive and supervise…
