  Adaptive sampling is an emerging technology to enrich target reads while depleting unwanted reads during real-time nanopore sequencing. The application of different algorithms has spawned various tools for the determination of read rejection. However, an evaluation in conjunction with identifying the optimal enrichment performance for a specific task has yet to be conducted. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of six widely used tools for nanopore adaptive sampling. Three distinct types of tasks were selected for testing, including the intraspecies enrichment of COSMIC genes, the inte

  Traditional disease risk prediction models predominantly rely on statistical algorithms and often focus on genetic factors or a limited set of lifestyle factors to estimate the risk of disease onset. Recently, more comprehensive approaches have emerged that integrate genetic factors with additional lifestyle factors (e.g., alcohol intake) and physical features (e.g., body mass index, age) to increase predictive accuracy. Since the onset of complex diseases is often accompanied by the occurrence of comorbidities, incorporating medical history records is a critical yet underexplored avenue for i

  The oral microbiome plays a crucial role in the development and progression of diseases. The complex interactions between the oral microbiome and diseases are challenging for clinicians in clinical decision-making and scientific research. To address this gap, we developed an oral microbiome knowledge database (ORMCKB), to provide evidence for personalized medicine and scientific research in the oral microbiome-disease axis. The current version of ORMCKB contains 11,554 data entries, encompassing 6941 oral microbe taxonomies, 234 diseases, 220 interventions, and 175 bacteriostats extracted from

  Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition and the most common form of dementia. Recent developments in AD treatment call for robust diagnostic tools to facilitate medical decision-making. Despite progress for early diagnostic tests, there remains uncertainty about clinical use. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as a readily available imaging tool in the current AD diagnostic pathway, in combination with artificial intelligence, offers opportunities of added value beyond symptomatic evaluation. However, MRI studies in AD tend to suffer from small datasets and conseque

  Perceptual decision-making is thought to be mediated by neuronal networks with attractor dynamics1,2. However, the dynamics underlying the complex neuronal responses during decision-making remain unclear. Here we use simultaneous recordings of hundreds of neurons, combined with an unsupervised, deep-learning-based method, to discover decision-related neural dynamics in the rat frontal cortex and striatum as animals accumulate pulsatile auditory evidence. We found that trajectories evolved along two sequential regimes: an initial phase dominated by sensory inputs, followed by a phase dominated

  Liquid biopsy enables noninvasive cancer diagnosis via the detection of circulating tumor cells and small extracellular vesicles (sEVs), yet accurate tumor subtype discrimination remains limited by low biomarker abundance. Here, we propose a low-cost, automated cancer classification platform based on freeze-thaw-induced floating patterns of gold nanoparticles (FTFPA), integrating smartphone-based image capture and AI-driven analysis.

  Traditionally, CT has been the go-to method for visualizing bone structures, while MRI has been preferred for assessing soft tissues, because structures containing tightly bound water molecules - such as bones, tendons, cartilage, and ligaments - produce a rapidly decaying T2* signal, which conventional MRI sequences fail to capture. To address this limitation, spoiled gradient echo sequences were refined, and short-TE sequences were introduced, enabling radiation-free bone imaging. This advance is particularly crucial for pediatric patients and in scenarios where an MRI-only approach is prefe

- **Spatiotemporal graph neural process for reconstruction, extrapolation,   and classification of cardiac trajectories**（2025-09-16） · *arXiv*
  We present a probabilistic framework for modeling structured spatiotemporal dynamics from sparse observations, focusing on cardiac motion. Our approach integrates neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), graph neural networks (GNNs), and neural processes into a unified model that captures uncertainty, temporal continuity, and anatomical structure. We represent dynamic systems as spatiotemporal multiplex graphs and model their latent trajectories using a GNN-parameterized vector field. Given the sparse context observations at node and edge levels, the model infers a distribution over lat

- **Data Scaling Laws for Radiology Foundation Models**（2025-09-16） · *arXiv*
  Foundation vision encoders such as CLIP and DINOv2, trained on web-scale data, exhibit strong transfer performance across tasks and datasets. However, medical imaging foundation models remain constrained by smaller datasets, limiting our understanding of how data scale and pretraining paradigms affect performance in this setting. In this work, we systematically study continual pretraining of two vision encoders, MedImageInsight (MI2) and RAD-DINO representing the two major encoder paradigms CLIP and DINOv2, on up to 3.5M chest x-rays from a single institution, holding compute and evaluation pr

  Despite significant medical advancements, cancer remains the second leading cause of death, with over 600,000 deaths per year in the US. One emerging field, pathway analysis, is promising but still relies on manually derived wet lab data, which is time-consuming to acquire. This work proposes an efficient, effective end-to-end framework for Artificial Intelligence (AI) based pathway analysis that predicts both cancer severity and mutation progression, thus recommending possible treatments. The proposed technique involves a novel combination of time-series machine learning models and pathway an

  Multimodal data provides heterogeneous information for a holistic understanding of the tumor microenvironment. However, existing AI models often struggle to harness the rich information within multimodal data and extract poorly generalizable representations. Here we present MICE (Multimodal data Integration via Collaborative Experts), a multimodal foundation model that effectively integrates pathology images, clinical reports, and genomics data for precise pan-cancer prognosis prediction. Instead of conventional multi-expert modules, MICE employs multiple functionally diverse experts to compre

- **DeepEyeNet: Generating Medical Report for Retinal Images**（2025-09-16） · *arXiv*
  The increasing prevalence of retinal diseases poses a significant challenge to the healthcare system, as the demand for ophthalmologists surpasses the available workforce. This imbalance creates a bottleneck in diagnosis and treatment, potentially delaying critical care. Traditional methods of generating medical reports from retinal images rely on manual interpretation, which is time-consuming and prone to errors, further straining ophthalmologists' limited resources. This thesis investigates the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automate medical report generation for retinal images

  The increasing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare necessitates a rigorous evaluation of their factual reliability. However, existing benchmarks are often limited by narrow domains of data, failing to capture the complexity of real-world medical information. To address this critical gap, we introduce MedFact, a new and challenging benchmark for Chinese medical fact-checking. MedFact comprises 2,116 expert-annotated instances curated from diverse real-world texts, spanning 13 medical specialties, 8 fine-grained error types, 4 writing styles, and multiple difficulty levels.
